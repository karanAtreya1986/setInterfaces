HashSet and treeSet are non-synchronized. i. e. both are non-thread safe. 
To synchronize explicitly, use the Collections class.
Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet)
HashSet better performance for adding, removing and many other things since no ordering 
so light weight API.
HashSet does not have any sorting within, treeSet sorts output in ascending order.
HashSet -> one null key allowed, treeSet -> no null key allowed.
